# ðŸ“ˆ Subgraph

Passage uses [subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/introduction/#what-the-graph-is) for indexing and organizing data from the Passage smart contracts. These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query your memberships data.

## Networks

Each network has it's own unique subgraph [endpoint](Subgraph/SubgraphEndpoints.md). Every Passport or Loyalty Ledger contract that is created from the Passage Registry is automatically indexed by the subgraph.
